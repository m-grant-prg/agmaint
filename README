1 ... Project Description
=========================

This is a simple script to reduce repetitive typing of some apt-get maintenance
commands.

The script sequentially invokes:-
	apt-get upgrade
	apt-get autoclean
	apt-get check
	apt-get autoremove

For the 'apt-get upgrade' command to have an up to date impact, agmaint should
be run soon after an 'apt-get update' has been performed.

agmaint must be run with root privileges.
